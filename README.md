# FA24-AusdallTV
## Advanced project for Mixed Reality Design.
Focused on climb-based locomotion in unreal engine VR. Project is developed & tested with the Oculus Quest 2.
Ground based locomotion is connected with the climb locomotion system, allowing for 1:1 mapped virtual movement based on hand movement.

## Citations & Resources Used:
Some of the player collision and playspace movement was loosely based on “Environment Collision in Virtual Reality - Unreal Engine VR Tutorial” - VR Playground <br />
[Environment Collision in Virtual Reality - Unreal Engine VR Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxgx53ZoO7Q) <br />
The final version I used has more to it in order to account for the locomotion method used in my project, and snap turn.<br /><br />
Some of the VR Pawn setup is based on the VR Pawn setup in (specifically related to changing the parent class & getting that working) “UE5 VR SMOOTH LOCOMOTION | Unreal Engine 5.2 Tutorial + Environment Showcase” - DrakeMakes<br />

The Unreal Engine VR 5.3.2 Template was used as a basis when starting on this project. <br />
The rock and crystal models (2 models total) were made by me working on a previous project and was reused here.
