## Advanced project for Mixed Reality Design.
Focused on climb-based locomotion in unreal engine VR. Project is developed & tested with the Oculus Quest 2.
Ground based locomotion is connected with the climb locomotion system, allowing for 1:1 mapped virtual movement based on hand movement.

## Citations & Resources Used:
Some of the player collision and playspace movement was loosely based on “Environment Collision in Virtual Reality - Unreal Engine VR Tutorial” - VR Playground

The final version I used has more to it in order to account for the locomotion method used in my project, and snap turn.
Some of the VR Pawn setup is based on the VR Pawn setup in (specifically related to changing the parent class & getting that working) “UE5 VR SMOOTH LOCOMOTION | Unreal Engine 5.2 Tutorial + Environment Showcase” - DrakeMakes

I used the Unreal Engine Developer Documentation as reference when working on certain parts of the project. Specific articles:

I also used the blender default keymap reference when working on blender projects:

The Unreal Engine VR 5.3.2 Template was used as a basis when starting on this project.
The rock model was made by me working on a previous project and was reused here.
